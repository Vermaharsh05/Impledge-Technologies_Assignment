# used  Scanner class to read lines from the input file, and then store them in an ArrayList.
# The program employs a recursive approach to check if a word can be split into smaller words found in the list, enabling the identification of compound words by breaking them down into smaller components.
# isCompoundWord method recursively checks if a word can be split into smaller words present in the list, ensuring the identification of compound words based on the concatenation of shorter words.
# By iterating through the list of words and checking for compound word conditions, the program aims to efficiently identify compound words while considering the length and composition of each word.
# program measures the time taken to process the input file, providing insights into the performance of the compound word identification process.
# program includes exception handling to manage potential FileNotFoundException when reading the input file, ensuring robustness in handling file-related errors.
